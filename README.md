An evolutionary approach to find/invent activation functions using Genetic Algorithms and by testing and benchmarking
those candid functions against some datasets (currently mnist).

## Installation:

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/GeneAct.git
    cd GeneAct
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run main.py

TODO:

- Improve the genetic algorithm to help the chance of more complicated and novel functions to arise
- code a CNN network for cifar10 and then running activation functions on it.
- better ui
- add plotting and statistical tools
